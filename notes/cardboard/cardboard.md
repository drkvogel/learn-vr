### copper/foil trick

use something conductive e.g. copper tape or aluminium foil to extend the capacitive touch-sensitivity of the screen:

>I don't know about the copper tape method. But you could try placing a magnet inside your viewer and taping it down with sticky tape. Then place a magnet on the outside (the magnetic force from the internal magnet should keep it in place). Then try playing a game. You should just need to slide the external magnet with your finger then release it so that it returns to its position. This magnetic field disturbance should trigger the command in the game. You may need to try different positions to get as close to the sensor in your phone as possible. Once you have worked out the best position you could make a small frame out of cardboard for the external magnet to sit in so that your finger doesn't knock it off. I have done all of this myself with my homemade cardboard and it worked for me.
The frame should look like this: http://g01.a.alicdn.com/kf/HTB1S9lsIVXXXXXVapXXq6xXFXXXN/In-Stock-Camouflage-Google-Cardboard-VR-3D-Glasses-with-Black-Magnet-for-iPhone-6-5S-Samsung.jpg

use more magnets- no noticable difference


### bluetooth

* Use Your Xbox Wireless Controller on Samsung Gear VR (https://support.xbox.com/en-GB/xbox-one/accessories/use-samsung-gear-vr-with-xbox-controller)
* Bluetooth keyboard/mouse, or ps3 controller

### gaze control

>Some of the apps have a gaze setting. So instead of pressing a button you can simply stare at the button you want to "click" and after a while it will select it if you stare at it long enough.

### software?
